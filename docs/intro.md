# Greek Anthology project
## For a digital and collaborative edition of the *Greek Anthology* 

Since 2014, the Canada Research Chair on Digital Textualities (directed by Marcello Vitali-Rosati) in collaboration with Elsa Bouchard and Christian Raschle has been carrying this large publishing project. The platform *Anthologia graeca* aims to gather as much information and data as possible on the *Greek Anthology* and to produce new ones, thus continuing the anthological enterprise. The platform includes, among other things, different versions of the Greek text, various translations into different languages, notes, commentaries, information on the authors, images of the codex (the palatinus graecus 23), keywords, places cited, etc. 

The platform [*anthologia graeca*](https://anthologiagraeca.org/) is built using a Django framework.  

Our [API](https://anthologiagraeca.org/api/) is structured with Postgress and is queryable in json
